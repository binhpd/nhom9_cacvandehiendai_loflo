    <hr>
    Suppose someone told you that an
    obscure programming technology, in continuous production
    use at one of Canada's major banks since the 1970s, provides an
    amazingly simple solution to a
    number of the major challenges facing today's programmers, including
    multicore machines and distributed computing, while providing
    improved maintainability, as well as a much more seamless
    transition
    from structured design to running code - would you reject this as
    a fairy tale, made up by impractical dreamers who know
    nothing about the application development business?&nbsp; You
    probably
    would!<br>
    <br>
    It's true though!&nbsp; The first implementation of these concepts,
    now being called "Flow-Based Programming" (FBP), was used to
    implement
    a
    significant proportion of the offline applications used by a large
    N.
    American
    bank, servicing around 5,000,000 customers, going live in the
    mid-1970s.&nbsp; FBP has allowed these applications to
    respond to
    changes in business needs and the systems environment, <span
      style="font-style: italic;">over a period of
      almost 40</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">years </span>(at
    least one
    of the applications which went live in 1975 is still in use today -
    2013 - processing around 5 million accounts daily), while
    still providing the
    high reliability required of
    banking applications.&nbsp;
    As a bonus, these programs actually ran in less elapsed time than
    programs
    written using conventional
    techniques.&nbsp; FBP is (and was then) a brand new way of thinking
    about application
    development, freeing the programmer from von
    Neumann thinking, one of the major barriers to moving to the new
    multiprocessor world, and has been evolving steadily over the
    intervening years.&nbsp; It has now been implemented using both Java
    and C#
    multithreading.&nbsp; Using these implementations, you can now
    easily
    take advantage of the processing power of all your machine's
    processors. Of course,
    there <i>is</i>
    a paradigm change, but, once you have made the shift, you can't go
    back!<br>
    <br>
    FBP was actually invented/discovered back in the late 1960s, but it
    took us several decades to understand its potential!
    &nbsp;
    During that period we came to realize that this technology solves
    many of the old problems that have always bedeviled conventional
    programming, but
    it also has the potential to simplify many of the new problems that
    we
    are just now
    starting to run into.&nbsp; FBP is now starting to catch on in a big
    way. &nbsp; More and more programmers are now saying:
    <p class="gowiththeflow">Go with the flow!</p>

      and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/paul_morrison">Lulu</a>.
      Take a look and see how FBP has changed over the past 16 years!
    </p>
    <p>The new edition contains information about the Java and C#
      implementations, as well as the diagramming tool (<a
        href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/#DrawFBP">DrawFBP</a>),
      several
      sections contributed by Mike Beckerle, CTO of Oco Inc., on his
      experience using FBP concepts on truly humongous amounts of data,
      plus
      a whole new chapter on software projects that have appeared in the
      last
      16 years and either build on FBP, or have strong similarities to
      it.
      And, of course, FBP is the obvious technology for application
      development involving multi-processor computers and networks of
      computers, so this is addressed in several of the chapters.
    </p>
    <p>For obvious reasons, the new sections are not available on this
      web
      site - but just think, you could have a shiny new copy in your
      hands,
      printed with loving care by <a
        href="https://www.createspace.com/3439170">CreateSpace</a> - and
      IMHO
      it looks just as
      good as the original edition (if not better)!<br>

NoFlo has been recognized by Forbes, O'Reilly, FastCompany, and many other companies and publications.  FBP seems to finally be taking off!

    <h3><a name="Gen"></a>General</h3>
    <p>Flow-Based Programming is a new/old approach to application
      development, based on a completely different way of thinking about
      building applications. Some of its roots can be traced all the way
      back to the early days of computing, yet it offers solutions to
      many
      of the most pressing problems facing application development
      today. </p>
    <p>Not surprisingly parts of the answer have been presaged many
      times
      over in the past, but the 1st edition (1994) of my book on the
      subject,
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0442017715">"Flow-Based
        Programming",
        van
        Nostrand
        Reinhold,
        1994,
        ISBN
        0-442-01771-5</a> was
      the first book to tie together many of these different efforts,
      and
      to point towards a very practical, powerful, yet perfectly
      realizable
      future of application development. The 2nd edition came out with
      the
      assistance of CreateSpace in 2010 - <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Flow-Based
        Programming,
        2nd
        Edition:

        New
        Approach
        to
        Application
        Development,
        CreateSpace,
        2010,
        ISBN
        1451542321</a> - and contains contributions
      from a number of people who have been working with the technology
      over
      the last 16 years. It is also available in ebook format from
      Amazon.com
      and Lulu.com.
    </p>
    <p>In "Flow-Based Programming" (FBP), applications are
      defined as networks of "black box" processes, which
      exchange data across predefined one-way connections. These black
      box
      processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different
      applications
      without having to be changed internally. It is thus naturally
      <i>component-oriented</i>. To describe this capability, Raoul de
      Campo of IBM Research coined the term "<i>configurable
        modularity</i>", and it was later adopted and developed by the
      distinguished IBM engineer, Nate Edwards, who described it as "the
      basis of all true engineered systems." </p>
    <p>When using FBP, the application developer works with flows of
      data, being processed asynchronously, rather than the conventional
      single hierarchy of sequential, procedural code. This means that
      the
      precise timing of events can usually not be predicted exactly,
      which
      tends to make old-style programmers nervous. However, it turns out
      that this isn't really necessary (and never has been!), and in
      fact
      shifts the emphasis from sequences of actions to transformations
      performed on streams of data. </p>
    <p>FBP is thus a good fit with multiprocessor computers, and also
      with modern embedded software. In many ways, an FBP application
      resembles more closely a real-life factory, where items travel
      from
      station to station, undergoing various transformations.&nbsp;
      Think
      of a soft drink bottling factory, where bottles are filled at one
      station, capped at the next and labelled at yet another one.&nbsp;
      FBP is therefore highly <i>visual</i>: it is quite hard to work
      with
      an FBP application without having the picture laid out on one's
      desk,
      or up on a screen!&nbsp; For an example, see <a
        href="image010.jpg">a
        portion of a batch program</a> (you have to zoom in to see some
      of
      the connections). This diagram, which was built using the earlier
      C++
      <a href="#DrawFBP">DrawFBP</a> diagramming tool, only shows <i>part</i>
      of an extremely complex program, which was running almost daily
      for
      over 30 years (it has since been replaced). Now imagine building
      the same function
      using a conventional programming language!</p>
    <p>Strangely though, in spite of being at the leading edge of
      application development, it is also simple enough that trainee
      programmers can pick it up, and it is a much better match with the
      primitives of data processing than the conventional primitives of
      procedural languages. </p>
    <p>In recent years, the concept seems to have started to take off -
      this seems to be coinciding with a feeling that Object-Oriented
      isn't
      the perfect solution to all our problems that it was originally
      believed to be. More and more projects and papers use the term
      Flow-Based Programming (often in lower case) - to the point where
      it
      has started to be a generic term (like Bandaid in N. America!).
      For a
      fairly lengthy list of projects, papers, and even companies, that
      seem to be using related concepts, see the Wiki page called <a

      SourceForge,
      as
      well
      as
      a
      picture-drawing
      tool
      that
      supports
      many

    <h3><a name="Hist"></a>History</h3>
    <p>The earliest implementations of FBP concepts are described in the
      <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/intro.shtml">Introduction</a>
      to the book, and were built for IBM mainframes.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>For PCs, there was an early implementation called <a
        href="#THREADS">THREADS</a>,
      also
      described
      in
      the
      book,
      followed
      by
      Java
      (<a href="#JavaFBP">JavaFBP</a>)
      and
      C# (<a href="#CsharpFBP">C#FBP</a>) implementations (developed
      after the book was published).&nbsp; The network syntax and
      component
      API are described in <a
        href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/threads.shtml">THREADS
        API and Network Specification</a> .</p>
    <p>The latest version of <a href="#JavaFBP">JavaFBP</a> is
      available
      on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flow-based-pgmg">SourceForge</a>
      and also on the FBP web site in non-executable jar file format -
      <a href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/JavaFBP-2.6.jar">JavaFBP
        jarfile</a>.&nbsp; Its network syntax and component API are
      described
      in <a href="jsyntax.htm">"JavaFBP Network Syntax and Component
        API"</a>. </p>
    <p>The latest version of&nbsp; <a href="#CsharpFBP">C#FBP</a> is
      available on SourceForge and on the FBP web site - <a
        href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/CsharpFBP-2.3.zip">C#FBP
        zipfile</a>.&nbsp; Its network syntax and component API are
      described
      in <a href="csyntax.htm">"C#FBP Network Syntax and Component
        API"</a>. </p>
    <p>A new feature of both of these releases is the addition of
      metadata (or "attributes") to components, giving port names
      and characteristics, and the "must run" attribute. This is
      intended to allow diagramming tools to display port names and use
      this information for various types of checking. If you are
      currently
      working with a previous version of JavaFBP, the metadata will have
      to
      be added to your existing components, but this only has to be done
      once, and hopefully will not be too onerous. </p>
    <p>A new, much more powerful, Java version of the&nbsp; <a
        href="#DrawFBP">DrawFBP</a>
      diagramming tool is now available.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I note that there is now a web site called <a
        href="http://www.flowbasedprogramming.com">www.flowbasedprogramming.com</a>
      - this is in fact the web site for Marcus Tomlinson's <a
        href="http://www.flowbasedprogramming.com/DSPatch/">DSPatch</a>
      - a very interesting C++-based implementation of the FBP paradigm
      that allows the user to create and route (or "patch") what the
      author calls "high performance data processing circuits".</p>
    <p>Last but not least, I am starting to have more time available,
      and
      I hope to move more into research on Flow-Based Programming (of
      course). As the signs are that FBP is finally starting to take
      off, I
      am hoping that interested individuals will start to contact me
      about
      ideas and possibilities in this area. In particular, I am looking
      for
      organizations that are willing to share their experience (and even
      componentry) with other organizations. If we could pool our
      resources, as is done in the Open Source community, we could
      bootstrap our productivity, and everyone benefits! Another
      interesting area where collaboration could take place is in the
      design and management of component repositories.</p>

    <p>Two reviews of "Flow-Based Programming" appeared a few
      years ago in one of the Australian computer journals, one by Tony
      Stevenson, then at Monash University, and the other by Andrew
      Wenn,
      of Victoria University of Technology (Footscray). The latter has a
      pretty complete description of FBP and of the contents of the
      book,
      as well as some (well-deserved) criticisms! To see them, click on
      <a href="review1.htm">Stevenson</a>, and <a href="review2.htm">Wenn</a>,

    <h3><a name="Papers"></a>Papers on FBP</h3>
    <p>There are some papers on FBP on my web site. Not surprisingly,
      there is some duplication as it is generally necessary to give a
      short description of the basic concepts in each one, but each
      paper
      has some unique sections. Here they are: </p>

    <h3><a name="THREADS"></a>C Implementation of FBP Concepts (THREADS)</h3>
    <p>The first implementation of the concepts of FBP for the PC was
      written in C, and was called THREADS. It used the Borland C
      compiler. It is
      described in the first edition of my book, "Flow-Based
      Programming",
      specifically in the Appendix (see <a href="threads.shtml">"THREADS
API
        and Network Specification"</a>). The code is in the
      process of being upgraded to use Win32 and "fibres" - I
      have put it up on my web site, called <a href="THREADS_32.zip">THREADS_32</a>.
      As
      it
      is
      fibre-based,
      it
      cannot
      make
      use
      of
      multiple
      processors,
      but
      initial
      testing
      suggests
      that,
      on the other hand, it is very fast!
      Although the revised code has survived some of its early tests, it
      obviously needs a lot more testing before it becomes "industrial
      strength".
    </p>
    <p>I would like to change the name to CppFBP, and
      in fact this name has started to be used in the code, but the book
      refers to it as THREADS_32, so I will retain that name for the zip
      file, for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>I am also uncertain how to implement component metadata, which I
      consider an important feature of the Java and C# implementations,
      so
      this is currently
      unsupported.</p>
    <h3><a name="JavaFBP"></a>Java Implementation of FBP Concepts
      (JavaFBP)</h3>
    <p>A Java implementation of Flow-Based Programming which we have
      called <b>JavaFBP</b> (formerly JFBP, formerly JavaFlow) is now
      available in open source form, and has been registered as a
      project
      on SourceForge, and the code has been uploaded onto the
      SourceForge
      File release System. It can be accessed by clicking here:
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flow-based-pgmg">SourceForge</a>.
      To
      download
      the
      source
      code,
      click
      on
      "files",
      and
      then
      download
      the
      latest
      release.
      An
      earlier
      version
      was
      uploaded
      onto
      the
      CVS
      server
      on
      SourceForge,
      but
      it
      is
      not
      up-to-date.
    </p>
    <p>The code (version 2.6) is also available on this web site. To
      download it, click
      here: <a href="JavaFBP-2.6.jar">JavaFBP jar file</a> (you may
      have to
      shift and click). </p>
    <p>This implementation was written by John Cowan and tweaked by me.
      It allows a developer to specify an application as a network of
      nodes, which are long-running Java threads, connected by
      fixed-capacity connections, over which data objects travel.&nbsp;
      We
      feel this approach lends itself to server applications where high
      throughput is required.&nbsp; It is easy to multiplex components
      that
      are either I/O-bound or CPU-bound (in the latter case this allows
      us
      to take advantage of the multiple processors in current machines).
      The network is also specified as a Java program, which we feel is
      a
      more flexible approach than designing a special-purpose language
      for
      this purpose. </p>
    <p>There is a web page describing the syntax of a JavaFBP network
      definition and showing a sample JavaFBP component - information
      will be
      added
      to this page as time permits. To see it, click on <a
        href="jsyntax.htm">JavaFBP
        Network
        Syntax
        and
        Component
        API</a>. </p>
    JavaFBP also supports "static subnets" - an example can
    be found in the jar file, and there is a fairly complete description
    of how it works in <a href="compos.shtml">Composite Components</a>,
    particularly in the second half, including "substream
    sensitivity".
    <p>Please feel free to look at the code, and/or contact me for more
      information, or to give me feedback. </p>
    <p>As of version 2.5, the following features were added
      (also described in <a href="jsyntax.htm">JavaFBP
        Network
        Syntax
        and
        Component
        API</a>) :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>isConnected() now works on element basis</li>
      <li>port name without element number can be used in place of
        port_name[0] </li>
      <li>optional array size on openArrayPort (In/Out); annotation
        should
        say fixedSize</li>
      <li>if non-optional array, at least one element must be connected</li>
      <li>send to unconnected port element should generate message and
        crash if&nbsp; "optional" not specified AND isConnected() not
        used in
        code</li>
      <li>added an annotation called SelfStarting to indicate that a
        component starts
        at the
        beginning of job <span style="font-style: italic;">even if</span>
        it
        has input ports</li>
      <li>you can indicate that you want to check count of entities sent
        on
        connection, via an optional
        boolean parameter specified on connect() method; capacity and
        optional
        boolean can be in either order.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A sample component has been added
        called DispIPCounts, which outputs
        the requested counts at intervals specified in an IIP, just to
        give an
        idea of what could be done.</li>
      <li>there are now a couple of "shorthands" to reduce the number of
        metadata statements needed to describe multiple ports that have
        the
        same characteristics - they are
        described in detail in <a href="jsyntax.htm">JavaFBP
          Network
          Syntax
          and
          Component
          API</a> .</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As of version 2.6, JavaFBP now checks that components only
      receive
      and send packets containing data of the type specified in the
      class
      annotations. This uses the Java <tt>isAssignableFrom()</tt>
      method -
      e.g. if the port annotations specify <tt>Object</tt> (the
      default),
      this port may send or receive packets containing anything.
    </p>
    <p>Input ports and input port array elements are automatically
      optional
      -
      this has not changed since earlier releases.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Please note that, as of the
        2.5
        version, process names and port names may only contain Unicode
        letters, figures, underscore and blank, as suggested by one of
        JavaFBP's registered users.&nbsp; We hope this does not disturb
        any
        current applications, but we judged this was necessary to
        protect the
        extension possibilities for JavaFBP.&nbsp; A similar change will
        be
        made to C#FBP shortly.</span><br>

    <h3><a name="CsharpFBP"></a>C# Implementation of FBP Concepts </h3>
    <p>Several years ago, Amanda Ge kindly converted the pre-5.0 Java
      version to C#, but did not have time to test it. With input from
      David Bennett in Melbourne, Australia, I have upgraded my C#
      implementation and it is now available on SourceForge and on my
      web
      site. There is a <i>readme</i> file describing the new features.
    </p>
    <p>The new version of C#FBP can be found at <a
        href="CsharpFBP-2.3.zip">C#FBP</a>
      (you may have to shift and click), and on <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flow-based-pgmg">SourceForge</a>.
      The
      source
      code
      is
      now
      available
      on
      SourceForge
      SVN.
      Please
      feel
      free
      to
      play
      with
      it
      -
      and
      let
      me
      know
      how
      you
      make
      out.
      I
      will
      of
      course
      post
      updates
      as
      required.
      If
      you
      have
      already
      taken
      a

      please
      download
      the
      latest
      version!</p>
    <p>A page has been added to this site describing the syntax of a

    <h3><a name="DrawFBP"></a>DrawFBP</h3>
    <p>Several years ago, a picture-drawing tool which supports many of
      the concepts of FBP was written in C++ for Windows. It can still
      be
      obtained by clicking here: <a href="drawFBP.0.1.zip">DrawFBP-C++</a>,&nbsp;
      but
      it
      has
      now
      been
      superseded
      by
      a
      Java
      version,
      which
      can
      be
      obtained
      by
      clicking
      here:
      <a
href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/graphicsstuff/DrawFBPInstaller-2.8.zip">DrawFBP
        Installer</a>, and this is also
      available on <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/flow-based-pgmg">SourceForge</a>
      - look for the 2.8 version. This version is <i>much</i> more
      powerful, has fairly decent help facilities, and can generate
      runnable Java, C# or <a href="http://noflojs.org/">NoFlo</a>
      network
      definitions, if it is given enough
      information.&nbsp; You can
      now <i>draw</i> an application, click on "Generate Network", fill
      in a
      few missing bits of information (if any), and voilà - a running
      program! What's not to like?!</p>
